TITLE: Greetings and Personal Introduction

PINNED_BRIEF (UNIT_BRIEF):
- Level delivery: L0 ONLY. Keep it ultra-simple. Use only Language Bank words. 1 question per turn. 1–2 short sentences max.
- Goals (in order): Greetings → Name → Feelings → Likes → Mini self-intro.
- Checkpoints & micro-prompts:
  A) Greetings
     - Prompt: “Say: Hello!”   Target: “Hello!”
     - Then: “Say: Good morning!”  Target: “Good morning!”
     - Then: “Say: Good night!”    Target: “Good night!”
  B) Name
     - Prompt: “What’s your name?”  Target: “My name is ___.”
     - If needed: “Say: My name is ___.”
  C) Feelings
     - Prompt: “How are you?”  Target: “I am happy.” (or “I am sad.”)
     - If needed: “Say: I am happy.”
  D) Likes
     - Prompt: “What color do you like?”  Target: “I like blue.”
     - Then (optional 1x): “What food do you like?”  Target: “I like pizza.”
  E) Self-intro (exit)
     - Prompt: “Say: Hello! My name is ___. I am happy. I like blue.”
     - Accept any correct short variant (2–3 clauses).

- Language Bank: Hello, Good morning, Good night, What’s your name?, My name is…, How are you?, I am happy/sad, I like…, blue, pizza, Bye-bye.
- Error policy (L0): praise → try once → give model and move on.
- Exit Goal: learner says a 1–3 sentence mini self-intro; tutor congratulates and ends: “press the black button to go back”.
