TITLE: Greetings and Personal Introduction

PINNED_BRIEF (UNIT_BRIEF):
- Goals: greet, ask/say name, express simple feelings, and likes (color/food).
- Checkpoints:
  1) Greetings (Hello/Hi/Good morning/Good night)
  2) Name (What’s your name? My name is…)
  3) Feelings (I am happy/sad)
  4) Likes (I like blue/pizza)
  5) Self-intro (Hello! My name is ___. I am happy. I like ___)
- Language Bank: Hello, Hi, Good morning, Good night, What’s your name?, My name is…, I am happy/sad, I like…, Bye-bye.
- Exit Goal: student gives a 1–3 sentence self-introduction; AI congratulates and ends: “press the black button to go back”.
