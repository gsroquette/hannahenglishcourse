### **Step 1: Preparing the Activity**

- **Materials:**
  - Printed **Greeting Cards** (two versions):
    - Round 1 — *Mary & Elizabeth dialogue (original names)*
    - Round 2 — *Blank-name version for personalization*
  - Emoji cards (happy, neutral, sad)
  - Poster with the title: **"Hello, My Friend!"**
  - Optional background music to create a joyful and peaceful environment
  - Optional props for role play (shawls, baskets, small decorations)

---

### **Step 2: How to Play**

1) **"Say it with a Smile" – Warm-up**
   - The teacher shows emoji cards to the students.
   - Students greet according to the emotion shown:
     - happy: *"Hello! How are you?"* → *"I’m good!"*
     - neutral: *"Hello! How are you?"* → *"I’m okay."*
     - sad: *"Hello! How are you?"* → *"I’m not so good."*
   - *Goal:* connect emotions, tone, and vocabulary naturally.

2) **"Hello, My Friend!" – Role Play (Round 1: Mary & Elizabeth)**
   - Students work in pairs.
   - Each pair receives the **original dialogue cards** of Mary and Elizabeth.
   - They act out the conversation using smiles, gestures, and friendly tone.

   **Dialogue Example (Round 1):**
   - Mary: *Hello, Elizabeth! How are you?*
   - Elizabeth: *I’m good, thank you! And you?*
   - Mary: *I’m good too!*
   - Elizabeth: *Goodbye, Mary! God bless you!*
   - Mary: *Goodbye, Elizabeth! See you soon!*

3) **"Hello, My Real Friend!" – Role Play (Round 2: Personalized Version)**
   - Students now use the **blank cards** and write their **real names**.
   - They perform the same dialogue but greeting **real classmates**.
   - Rotate partners to create a quick **Speed Greeting Game**.

   **Personalized Dialogue Example (Round 2):**
   - Student A: *Hello, __________! How are you?*
   - Student B: *I’m good, thank you! And you?*
   - Student A: *I’m good too!*
   - Student B: *Goodbye, __________! God bless you!*
   - Student A: *Goodbye, __________! See you soon!*

4) **"Greeting Match Quest" – Matching Game**
   - Mix greeting cards with response cards.
   - Students must find the correct matches.
   - **Scoring:** Each correct match = **1 point**; the team with most points wins **"Friendly Angels!"**

   **Greeting → Response (examples):**
   - **Hello!** → *Hi!*
   - **What’s your name?** → *My name is Mary.*
   - **How are you?** → *I’m good, thank you!*
   - **Goodbye!** → *See you soon!*
   - **God bless you!** → *Thank you!*

5) **"Create Your Greeting Card" – Creative Writing & Drawing**
   - Each student creates a **Greeting Card** for a friend.
   - Include a drawing and 2–4 short sentences using target phrases.

   **Examples:**
   - *Hello! My name is John.*
   - *I’m 10 years old.*
   - *I’m good, thank you!*
   - *Goodbye! See you soon!*

### **Step 3: Reflection Moment**

- **Discuss:**
  - *How do you feel when someone says "Hello" to you?*
  - *Why did Mary visit Elizabeth?*
  - *How can we show love when we greet people?*
- **Write 1 sentence:** *"I can show love when I say hello to my friends."*

### **Extra Challenge:**

Students create a **short original dialogue** using greetings and introductions with their own names, then perform it for the class. Encourage natural gestures (wave, handshake) and clear pronunciation.

---

**Conclusion:**
This activity unites **grammar**, **interaction**, and **values**, helping students use English greetings with joy and kindness — just like **Mary and Elizabeth**.
