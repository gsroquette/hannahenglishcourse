### **🧩 Step 1 – Warm-up: "Say it with a Smile!"**

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Materials:** Emoji cards (happy, neutral, sad)

**How to do it:**  

The teacher shows emoji cards 😃 😐 😞.  

Students practice greetings according to the emotion shown:  

😃 *"Hello! How are you?"* → *"I’m good!"*  
😐 *"Hello! How are you?"* → *"I’m okay."*  
😞 *"Hello! How are you?"* → *"I’m not so good."*  

💡 **Goal:** Warm up the vocabulary and help students use emotion and tone when greeting others.

### **🗣️ Step 2 – "Hello, My Friend!" (Role Play with Greeting Cards)**

**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Materials:** Dialogue cards (with names + blank-name version)  
📄 The PDF **"Greeting_Cards_Hello_My_Friend.pdf"** includes both versions ready to print.

**🎬 How it works**  

**Round 1 – Mary & Elizabeth**  

Students work in pairs.  
Each pair receives a set of cards showing the original dialogue between Mary and Elizabeth.  
They act out the dialogue using natural gestures and friendly tone.  

🟦 **Model Dialogue (Round 1):**  
- Mary: *Hello, Elizabeth! How are you?*  
- Elizabeth: *I’m good, thank you! And you?*  
- Mary: *I’m good too!*  
- Elizabeth: *Goodbye, Mary! God bless you!*  
- Mary: *Goodbye, Elizabeth! See you soon!*  

💡 **Tip:** The teacher can play soft background music to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere, like the joyful meeting of the two friends.

🔁 **Round 2 – "Hello, My Real Friend!"**  

Now, the teacher gives out the same cards but with blank spaces for names.  
Students write their own names in the blanks and act out the same conversation using real classmates’ names.  

🟡 **Personalized Version (Round 2):**  
- Student A: *Hello, __________! How are you?*  
- Student B: *I’m good, thank you! And you?*  
- Student A: *I’m good too!*  
- Student B: *Goodbye, __________! God bless you!*  
- Student A: *Goodbye, __________! See you soon!*  

💬 Students change partners and repeat the dialogue several times — creating a fun *"Speed Greeting Game."*  
Each new partner gives them a chance to practice again naturally.
