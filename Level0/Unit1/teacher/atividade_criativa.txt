## **Step 2: How to Play**

### 1️⃣ **“Watch and Do” – Teacher Demonstration (Warm-up)**

The teacher says the command aloud and performs the action. Students imitate silently.

Examples:

* “LOOK!” → point to eyes
* “LISTEN!” → hands on ears
* “STAND UP!” → everyone stands
* “SIT DOWN!” → everyone sits
* “BE QUIET!” → finger on lips

**Goal:** connect words to actions without translation.

### 2️⃣ **“Pick a Command” – Circle Game**

1. Students sit in a circle.
2. The teacher places all command cards face down in the center.
3. One student picks a card.
4. The student shows the card to the class.
5. The whole class performs the command together.

📌 **Example:**
The student picks **SHARE** → everyone passes an object to a classmate.

### 3️⃣ **“Follow the Sequence” – Cooperative Challenge**

The teacher gives a sequence of commands aloud:

1. “LOOK.”
2. “LISTEN.”
3. “STAND UP.”
4. “BE KIND.”
5. “HELP your friend.”

Students must perform the actions **in the correct order**.

* If the class succeeds → they earn **one collective point**.
* The focus is teamwork, not competition.

## **Extra Challenge: Classroom Command Story**

Students act out a short sequence as a mini-drama:

The teacher says:

* “LOOK at your friend.”
* “LISTEN carefully.”
* “BE KIND.”
* “HELP your friend.”
* “SIT DOWN.”

Students perform the actions as if they are in a real classroom story.

## **Conclusion**

This activity integrates **language, movement, cooperation, and values**, helping children understand English commands naturally while learning to act with respect, kindness, and teamwork in their classroom — just like in a **friendly learning community**.
