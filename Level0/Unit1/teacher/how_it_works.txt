### **5. Hannah Exercises – Learning for Real with the Brain in Action**

#### **Objective**
The purpose of these exercises is to **help children truly retain and use what they’ve learned**—vocabulary, grammar, listening, reading, and writing—through short and engaging tasks. They allow students to **remember, understand, and use English naturally**, without rote memorization.

---

#### **Neuroscience Foundation**
**Hannah Exercises** are built on principles of **learning neuroscience**.  
They are designed to activate different areas of the brain, making learning deeper, longer-lasting, and more enjoyable.

- **Remembering is learning:** when a child tries to recall a word or answer, the brain creates stronger memory connections.  
- **Repetition over time:** doing similar activities on different days tells the brain that the information is important and should be stored permanently.  
- **Multisensory learning:** listening, seeing, and interacting (clicking, speaking, repeating) connect sound, image, and meaning in the brain.  
- **Positive reinforcement:** sounds, confetti, and encouraging words activate the brain’s reward system, which increases motivation and focus.  

These strategies make learning **active, lasting, and joyful**.

---

#### **Activity Types**
In these exercises, students may find:
- **Multiple Choice:** choose the correct word or image.  
- **Fill in the Blanks:** complete sentences with missing words.  
- **Sentence Building:** arrange words in the correct order.  
- **Matching:** connect words and pictures.  
- **Listen and Repeat:** practice pronunciation and listening comprehension.  

Each type targets a specific skill, strengthening memory, focus, and language integration.

---

#### **How to Apply**
**Hannah Exercises** are flexible and can be used in different classroom setups:
1. **Individually:** each student works on their own tablet or computer, following their own pace.  
2. **Whole class:** project the activity on a TV or screen and answer together as a group.  
3. **In teams:** divide the class into groups and turn it into a fun competition—each team tries to answer first.  
   Working cooperatively and playfully also supports brain-based learning by increasing engagement and emotional connection.

---

#### **The Teacher’s Role**
During these activities, the teacher plays a key role as a **learning guide and encourager**.  
- Offer **positive reinforcement** (“Great job!”, “Good try!”, “You’re improving!”).  
- **Assist gently** when a student struggles, giving clues or examples instead of direct correction.  
- Emphasize that **making mistakes is part of learning**—they help the brain grow.  
- Encourage students to **speak aloud** and listen carefully.  
- Maintain a **happy and relaxed environment**, because the brain learns best when students feel safe, confident, and motivated.
