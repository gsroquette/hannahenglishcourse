### **Step 2: How to Play**

1️⃣ **"Say it with a Smile" – Warm-up**
   - The teacher shows emoji cards to the students.
   - Students greet according to the emotion shown:
     - 😃happy: *"Hello! How are you?"* → *"I’m good!"*
     - 😐neutral: *"Hello! How are you?"* → *"I’m okay."*
     - 😞sad: *"Hello! How are you?"* → *"I’m not so good."*
   - *Goal:* connect emotions, tone, and vocabulary naturally.
  
2️⃣ **"Hello, My Friend!" – Role Play (Round 1: Mary & Elizabeth)**
   - Students work in pairs.
   - Each pair receives the **original dialogue cards** of Mary and Elizabeth.
   - They act out the conversation using smiles, gestures, and friendly tone.

   📌**Dialogue Example (Round 1):**
   - Mary: *Hello, Elizabeth! How are you?*
   - Elizabeth: *I’m good, thank you! And you?*
   - Mary: *I’m good too!*
   - Elizabeth: *Goodbye, Mary! God bless you!*
   - Mary: *Goodbye, Elizabeth! See you soon!*

3️⃣ **"Hello, My Real Friend!" – Role Play (Round 2: Personalized Version)**
   - Students now use the **blank cards** and write their **real names**.
   - They perform the same dialogue but greeting **real classmates**.
   - Rotate partners to create a quick **Speed Greeting Game**.

   📌**Personalized Dialogue Example (Round 2):**
   - Student A: *Hello, __________! How are you?*
   - Student B: *I’m good, thank you! And you?*
   - Student A: *I’m good too!*
   - Student B: *Goodbye, __________! God bless you!*
   - Student A: *Goodbye, __________! See you soon!*

4️⃣ **"Greeting Match Quest" – Matching Game**
   - Mix greeting cards with response cards.
   - Students must find the correct matches.
   - **Scoring:** Each correct match = **1 point**; the team with most points wins **"Friendly Angels!"**

   📌**Greeting → Response (examples):**
   - **Hello!** → *Hi!*
   - **What’s your name?** → *My name is Mary.*
   - **How are you?** → *I’m good, thank you!*
   - **Goodbye!** → *See you soon!*
   - **God bless you!** → *Thank you!*

5️⃣ **"Create Your Greeting Card" – Creative Writing & Drawing**
