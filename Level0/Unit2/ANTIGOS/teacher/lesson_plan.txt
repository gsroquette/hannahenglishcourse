### **Lesson Plan Overview**

---

### **Introduction**

The **Hannah English Course** provides a clear and progressive learning pathway based on **educational neuroscience**.  
This approach helps children learn naturally, meaningfully, and effectively.

- **Frequent review** strengthens memory connections.  
- **Interactive repetition** promotes long-term retention.  
- **Emotional engagement** — through stories, visuals, games, and positive reinforcement — keeps the brain motivated and ready to learn.  

Each section integrates **biblical values, technology, and playfulness**, allowing children to learn English with purpose, joy, and meaning.

### **The Role of Hannah Video**

The **Hannah Video** is a key element in this strategy.  
It presents an **engaging Bible story** that simultaneously introduces the **English vocabulary and structures** that will be developed throughout the unit.  
This resource activates **emotion, curiosity, and comprehension** — three essential elements for learning according to neuroscience.

The video can always be accessed from the **Select an Activity** page.  
It should be **the very first thing viewed at the beginning of each unit** and can be **revisited at the start of every lesson** whenever needed, helping students reconnect emotionally with the theme and recall previous content.

### **Lesson Structure (2 hours per lesson)**

#### **1. Group Moment**
The lesson begins with the teacher leading the whole class together.

- Present the day’s theme, Bible story, or grammar point.  
- Use the classroom TV or projector to display the content clearly for everyone.  
- Encourage participation through simple questions, storytelling, or short warm-up activities.

#### **2. Interactive Activities**
Next, students access the **Hannah English Course** app to complete the interactive lesson activities.

- Includes reading, vocabulary, grammar, listening, pronunciation, writing, and speaking.  
- Activities feature games, challenges, and instant feedback with the help of artificial intelligence.

Teachers can apply these activities in various ways:

- **Individually**, with each student using their tablet.  
- **In groups**, projecting the activity on the TV or large screen.  
- **In teams**, turning questions into a friendly competition that fosters cooperation and joy.

During individual practice, the teacher should provide **personalized support**, encouraging and guiding each student according to their needs.

#### **3. Wrap-Up**
- Review vocabulary, grammar points, and spiritual lessons covered in the class.  
- Reinforce key expressions through repetition and speaking practice.  
- Conclude by celebrating students’ progress and, if desired, with a brief reflection or prayer.

The available options are:
