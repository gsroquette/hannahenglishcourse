Title: How Old Are You? — Counting with Baby Isaac

# Introduction to the Conversation Topic

In this lesson, you will practice asking and answering about age while using numbers 1–10. We connect our practice to the story of Abraham, Sarah, and baby Isaac—counting Isaac’s tiny fingers: one to ten.
**Key phrases:**

* **Question:** "How old are you?"
* **Answer:** "I am [number] years old."
  **Numbers (1–10):** one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
  **Friendly tip:** Smile, make eye contact, and speak slowly.
