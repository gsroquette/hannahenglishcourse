The Baby God Promised (Genesis 21)

Abraham and Sarah lived in Canaan. They were very old, but they loved God.

God said, “You will have a baby.” Sarah laughed and said, “I am ninety years old!”

God said, “Nothing is too hard for Me.” Abraham believed God’s promise.

One day, Sarah had a baby boy. Abraham named him Isaac. They counted his tiny fingers—one, two, three… ten!

Sarah smiled and said, “God has made me laugh with joy!” God keeps His promises. How old are you? God loves you too!
