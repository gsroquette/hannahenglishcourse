**Creative Activity: "Isaac’s Birthday Market — Counting & Age"**

**Objective:**
Students will practice **numbers 1–10** and **asking/answering about age** in a meaningful, story‑based context inspired by **Baby Isaac**. They will build simple oral interaction, clear pronunciation, and confidence.

### **Step 1: Preparing the Activity**

* **Materials:**

  * Picture cards: **counting_fingers.png**, **children_playing.png**, and 5 story cards (scenes 1–5)
  * **Age Badges** (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
  * Small **check cards** (for student points)
  * Optional gentle background music; optional simple props

---

### **Step 2: How to Play**

1️⃣ **“Fingers Count” – Warm‑up**

* Show **counting_fingers.png**.
* Class repeats numbers **1–10** with teacher.
* Students raise fingers as they count.
* *Goal:* connect number words with a physical gesture.

2️⃣ **“Age Market” – Pair Walk & Talk**

* Give each student **one Age Badge** (5–10).
* Students walk around and greet a classmate.
* Mini‑dialogue:

  * A: *"Hello! How old are you?"*
  * B: *"I am ___ years old."*
  * A (reformulation): *"You are ___ years old."*
* Switch roles; repeat with **5 classmates**. After each talk, mark **1 check** on the card.
* *Goal:* automatize the Q&A pattern with clear pronunciation (watch **eight**, **four**).

3️⃣ **“Promise Pictures” – Story Order & Acting**

* In small groups, give **5 story cards** (Baby Isaac) **shuffled**.
* Task 1: place the cards in the **correct order (1→5)**.
* Task 2: act each picture using **one short sentence**; for the “fingers” card, count aloud **one to ten**.
* Quick examples:

  * *"Abraham and Sarah lived in Canaan."*
  * *"Sarah laughed."*
  * *"Nothing is too hard for God."*
  * *"One, two, three… ten!"*
  * *"God keeps His promises. God loves you!"*

4️⃣ **“Greeting & Age Match” – Card Matching Race**

* Mix **question cards** and **answer cards** face‑down.
* Teams flip and find the correct pairs.
* **Scoring:** each correct match = **1 point**. Team with most points wins **“Counting Stars!”**
* Examples:

  * **How old are you?** → *I am seven years old.*
  * **Count to ten!** → *One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!*

5️⃣ **“My Age Card” – Create & Share**

* Each student makes a small **Age Card** (drawing + 2–3 sentences).
* Models:

  * *"Hello! My name is ____."*
  * *"I am ___ years old."*
  * *"I can count to ten!"*
* Students stand, show the card, and say one sentence to a partner.

### **Step 3: Reflection Moment**

* **Discuss:**

  * *Which number is easy for you? Which number is hard?*
  * *How did Abraham and Sarah feel?*
  * *What promise do you remember from the story?*
* **Write 1 sentence:** *"I can say my age and count to ten."*

---

### **Extra Challenge**

Students create a **very short dialogue** using names and ages, then perform it with **natural gestures** (wave, point to fingers). Encourage clear rhythm and smiling voice.

---

**Conclusion:**
This activity unites **grammar** (numbers 1–10; *How old are you? / I am ___ years old.*), **interaction**, and **values** from Baby Isaac’s story, helping learners speak with joy and confidence.
