### **Step 1: Preparing the Activity**

* **Materials:**

  * Picture cards: **counting_fingers.png**, **children_playing.png**, and **5 Baby Isaac story cards (scenes 1–5)**
  * **Age Badges** (5–10)
  * **Promise Pass** (card with 4 circles)
  * **Promise Stickers** (1 per step)
  * Small **check cards** (optional)
  * Optional background music

---

### **Step 2: How to Play**

Each step completed earns **1 Promise Sticker**. When students complete all 4 steps, they finish their **Promise Pass**.

1️⃣ **“Fingers Count” – Warm‑up**

* Show **counting_fingers.png**.
* Class repeats numbers **1–10** with teacher.
* Students raise fingers as they count.
* *Goal:* connect number words with a physical gesture.
* ✅ **Sticker 1** – after participating.

2️⃣ **“Age Market” – Pair Walk & Talk**

* Give each student **one Age Badge** (5–10).
* Students walk around and greet a classmate.
* Mini‑dialogue:

  * A: *"Hello! How old are you?"*
  * B: *"I am ___."*
  * A: *"You are ___!"*
* Students switch partners; repeat with **5 classmates**.
* *Goal:* practice the Q&A structure naturally.
* ✅ **Sticker 2** – after 3–5 successful interactions.

3️⃣ **“Promise Pictures” – Story Order & Acting**

* In small groups, give **5 story cards** (Baby Isaac) **shuffled**.
* Task 1: place the cards in the **correct order (1→5)**.
* Task 2: act each picture using **one short sentence**.

  * Examples:

    * *"They are old."*
    * *"Baby Isaac!"*
    * *"One, two… ten!"*
* *Goal:* sequence + produce short sentences.
* ✅ **Sticker 3** – after group presentation.

4️⃣ **“Greeting & Age Match” – Card Matching Race**

* Mix **question cards** and **answer cards** face‑down.
* Teams flip to find matching pairs.
* **Scoring:** each correct match = **1 point**. Team with most points wins **“Counting Stars!”**

*Examples (very basic):*

* **Hello!** → *Hello!*

* **How old are you?** → *I am six.*

* **Count to five!** → *One, two, three, four, five!*

* ✅ **Sticker 4** – after playing.

### **Step 3: Reflection Moment**

* **Discuss:**

  * *Which number is easy? Hard?*
  * *Can you ask: “How old are you?”*
* **Say together:** *"I can say my age and count to ten."*

---

### **Extra Challenge**

Students create a **very short dialogue** using names and ages, then perform with **gestures** (wave, show fingers).

---

**Conclusion:**
This activity practices **numbers 1–10** and **How old are you? / I am __.**
It builds confidence through simple speaking + movement.

---

**Notes:**
This lesson is grammar‑focused. Biblical reflection/values appear in another activity.
