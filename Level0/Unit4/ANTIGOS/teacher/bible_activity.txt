### FULL LESSON PLAN

1️⃣ **Story Time – “God’s Promise” (5–7 min)**

* Show story images of Abraham, Sarah, and Baby Isaac.
* Tell the story in simple language:

  * Abraham and Sarah were very old and had no baby.
  * God promised: "You will have a son!"
  * God kept His promise — Baby Isaac was born!
  * They counted his tiny fingers: one…ten!
* Connect:

  > Just like Isaac was God’s promise, YOU are also loved and planned by God.

2️⃣ **Craft – “I Am a Promise!” (10–12 min)**
Each child creates a personal promise card.

* Give each child half-sheet paper.
* Children trace and color their hand.
* Write:

  * My name is ______.
  * I am ___ years old.
* Optional: Write their age number inside the hand.
* Teacher walks around and practices:

  * How old are you?
  * I am ___ years old.

✅ **Meaning:**
Their hands remind us of Isaac’s ten fingers and that they are also a promise from God.

3️⃣ **Interactive Game – “Count & Celebrate!” (8–10 min)**

* Spread number cards (1–10) on the floor.
* Child chooses a number.
* Class counts to that number together (one–ten).
* Teacher asks: How old are you?
* Child answers.
* Child then adds their decorated hand card onto the mural:

  > **GOD KEEPS HIS PROMISES**
* Class responds: Thank You, God!

✅ **Purpose:**
The mural becomes a display of promises God has kept — each child is a gift from God.

4️⃣ **Reflection – Gratitude Moment (5 min)**
Gather around the mural.

* Ask:

  * How did Abraham and Sarah feel when God kept His promise?
  * Why can we trust God?
  * Why can we be thankful?
* Truth:

  > God kept His promise to Abraham and Sarah. God loves us and has a plan for us too!

Class repeats:

> Thank You, God!

5️⃣ **Optional Activity – Mini Challenge (3 min)**
