 Using "am/is/are" in Questions

In English, we use "am," "is," and "are" to ask questions. These are forms of the verb "to be." Look at the examples:

- "Am I late?" → "No, you are on time."
- "Is your mother at home?" → "No, she is out."
- "Are your parents at home?" → "No, they are out."
- "Is it cold in your room?" → "Yes, a little."
- "Are the stars bright?" → "Yes, they are."

 Sentence Structure
To form questions with "am/is/are," we change the order of words:

- Statement: "God is good."
- Question: "Is God good?"
- Statement: "The sky is blue."
- Question: "Is the sky blue?"
