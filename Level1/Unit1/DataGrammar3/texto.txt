Title: The Use of "A/An" in the Creation Story

# GRAMMAR  
The words **a** and **an** are indefinite articles. We use them to refer to one thing or person that is not specific. 

## **A or An?**  
- We use **a** before words that begin with a consonant sound.
- We use **an** before words that begin with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u).

### **Examples from the Bible**:  
- "God made **a** man and **a** woman." (Genesis 1)  
- "God created **an** earth and **an** ocean." (Genesis 1)  
- "On the fifth day, God made **a** bird and **an** eagle."  
- "God placed **a** light in the sky and **an** order to separate day and night."  

### **Exceptions**:  
- We use **an** before words where the **h** is silent:  
  - "God created **an** hour of rest on the seventh day." (Genesis 2)  
- We use **a** before words that start with a vowel letter but have a **y** sound:  
  - "God made **a** universe." (pronounced *yuniverse*)  
  - "God created **a** European garden." (pronounced *yuropean*)  

### **Another**  
The word **another** means "one more" or "a different one." It comes from **an + other**.  
- "God made **another** day for creation."  
- "Would you like **another** example?"  

### **A/An with Jobs and Professions**  
We use **a/an** when talking about jobs or professions.  
- "Adam was **a** gardener in Eden."  
- "Noah was **a** builder of the ark."  
- "Moses was **a** leader of Israel."  
- "Jesus was **a** teacher."
