Creation Story  (Genesis 1-2)


"Hello! My name is Hannah. I am a girl. I am happy to meet you! Let's learn English together. Today, I will tell you a special story. It is about the beginning of the world. Are you ready? Let's go!"


"In the beginning, there was nothing. Everything was dark. But God was there. God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light. God is powerful. God is good."


"God called the light 'day' and the darkness 'night.' There was evening, and there was morning. This was the first day. God is the Creator."


"On the second day, God made the sky. The sky is blue. God is creating everything. The sky is beautiful, and God is good."


"On the third day, God made the land and the sea. God said, 'Let the land have plants and trees.' Now there are flowers, trees, and water. God is amazing!"


"On the fourth day, God made the sun, the moon, and the stars. The sun is bright. The moon and stars are in the sky at night. God is great. God loves us."


"On the fifth day, God made fish and birds. Fish are in the water. Birds are in the sky. The birds are beautiful. God is kind. God made everything good."


"On the sixth day, God made animals on the land. There are big animals and small animals. Lions, elephants, and rabbits. God is the Creator. God is good."


"God also made people on the sixth day. God made a man and a woman. They are special. They are in God's beautiful garden. God loves people. God loves you!"


"On the seventh day, God rested. God saw everything He made, and it was very good. God is happy. We are happy too. Thank you, God!"


"Thank you for learning with me! God made everything. God is good, and God loves us. I am happy to be your friend. See you next time! Bye-bye!"
