Noah's Ark Party

[Verse]
The rain was falling from the sky
Noah's Ark was sailing high
Elephants went pawoo pawoo
God's love shining through and through

[Verse 2]
The lions roared a mighty roar
They knew what they were waiting for
Sheep went baa and cows went moo
God's care made them feel brand new

[Chorus]
Pawoo pawoo said the elephant loud
Baa baa baa the sheep so proud
Roar roar roar the lions say
God's care gets us through each day

[Verse 3]
Two by two they came aboard
In that boat they found accord
Birds went tweet and frogs said ribbit
God's care filled every spirit

[Verse 4]
Rain kept coming down so hard
And still they sailed by God's regard
Dogs went woof and cats said meow
God's care guiding them somehow

[Bridge]
Pawoo pawoo and baa baa baa
Roar roar roar itâ€™s an animal spa
Tweet and ribbit woof and meow
God's care keeping them strong now
