Hello! My name is Robot Samuel.
Hi! I'm a student.

Are you ready for our conversation?
Yes, I am!

Great! First, what is your name?
My name is Pedro.

Am I saying your name correctly, Pedro?
Yes, you are.

Good to know. Now, are you from this city?
No, I’m not. I’m from another town.

Oh, interesting! Is it far away?
Yes, it is a little far from here.

Are you studying English at school?
Yes, I am. It’s my favorite class.

Nice! Let’s talk about something from the Bible. Is Adam in the Garden of Eden in the story?
Yes, he is. He is with Eve.

Are they obeying God’s command?
Unfortunately, no, they aren’t.

Correct. Now, are you enjoying our conversation?
Yes, I am! It’s fun and very helpful.

Excellent! Thanks for talking with me today, Pedro. Bye!
Bye, Robot Samuel!
