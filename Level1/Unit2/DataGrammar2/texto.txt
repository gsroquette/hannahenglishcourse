Title: Question Words – Asking and Answering Questions

# Introduction
Hello everyone! Today, we are going to learn about Question Words in English.

What are Question Words?
They are special words that help us ask for information.
We use them to ask about things, people, places, time, reasons, and ways of doing things.

# Explanation
Here are the most common Question Words in English:

What → Thing → Example: "What is your name?" → "My name is Anna."
Where → Place → Example: "Where do you live?" → "I live in Brazil."
Who → Person → Example: "Who is your best friend?" → "My best friend is Lucas."
When → Time → Example: "When is your birthday?" → "My birthday is in July."
Why → Reason → Example: "Why do you like soccer?" → "Because it is fun!"
How → Way/manner → Example: "How are you?" → "I am fine, thank you!"
How old → Age → Example: "How old are you?" → "I am 10 years old."

How to make a question?
Most questions follow this pattern:
Question Word + auxiliary verb (do/does/is/are) + subject + verb/complement?

Examples:
"What do you like?" → "I like music."
"Where is your school?" → "My school is in London."
"How are you?" → "I am happy!"

Remember:
- If you ask about age, use "How old".
- If you ask about time, use "When".
- If you ask for a reason, use "Why".
