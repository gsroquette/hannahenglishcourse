Title: Greetings and Personal Introduction

# GRAMMAR
1. Greetings and Saying Hello

When we meet someone, we use greetings to say hello. Let's learn some common greetings in English!

Example:

- "Hello! My name is Hannah."
- "Hi! I'm Hannah."
- "Good morning! I am happy to meet you."

2. Introducing Yourself

When we want to introduce ourselves, we can say our name, age, and something about us.

Example:

- "My name is Hannah."
- "I'm 12 years old."
- "I am a student."
- "I am telling a story about the beginning of the world."

We can also share things we like:

- "My favorite sports are football and volleyball."
- "My favorite color is green."

3. Introducing Negative Information

Sometimes, we need to introduce something we are not or don't have.

Example:

- "I'm not American."
- "I am not a teacher."
