Title: Simple Questions with “am/is/are” – Adam and Eve

# GRAMMAR
1. Forming Questions with “am/is/are”
When we want to ask simple questions about identity, location, or basic descriptions, we use “am,” “is,” or “are” at the beginning of the sentence.

Examples:
- Am I your student?
- Is he in the garden?
- Are you ready?

Remember:
- “Am” is used with “I.”
- “Is” is used with “he,” “she,” “it” or a singular noun.
- “Are” is used with “you,” “we,” “they” or plural nouns.

2. Biblical Context: Adam and Eve
In the story of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3), we can practice asking simple questions:
- “Is Adam happy?”
- “Are they in the Garden of Eden?”
- “Is the snake talking?”

3. Short Answers
When we respond to these questions, we can give short answers:
- “Yes, I am. / No, I’m not.”
- “Yes, he is. / No, he isn’t.”
- “Yes, they are. / No, they aren’t.”
