Lesson | Obey God's Commands | God told Adam and Eve not to eat from one tree. They did not listen. We should listen to God. | "The Lord God gave the man a command. He said, 'You can eat the fruit of any tree that is in the garden. But you must not eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you do, you can be sure that you will die.'" (Genesis 2:16-17, NIrV)
Lesson | Resist Temptation | The serpent tricked Eve to eat the fruit. We must be careful and say no to wrong things. | "The serpent was more clever than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. The serpent said to the woman, 'Did God really say, 'You must not eat fruit from any tree in the garden'?" (Genesis 3:1, NIrV)
Lesson | Accept Responsibility | Adam blamed Eve, and Eve blamed the serpent. We should admit when we do wrong. | "The man said, 'It was the woman you put here with me. She gave me some fruit from the tree. And I ate it.' Then the Lord God said to the woman, 'What have you done?' The woman said, 'The serpent tricked me. That's why I ate the fruit.'" (Genesis 3:12-13, NIrV)
Lesson | Sin Has Consequences | Because they disobeyed, Adam and Eve had to leave the garden. Doing wrong brings problems. | "So the Lord God drove the man out of the Garden of Eden to work the ground he had been made out of." (Genesis 3:23, NIrV)
Lesson | God Still Loves Us | Even after they sinned, God made clothes for Adam and Eve. God cares for us always. | "The Lord God made clothes out of animal skins for Adam and his wife to wear. And he dressed them." (Genesis 3:21, NIrV)
