Title: "Between Dreams and Reality"

Synopsis:
Lucas is a 17-year-old with big dreams of becoming a game designer. He has great ideas and lots of creativity, but his family, especially his older brothers, often ignore or laugh at him. When Lucas is betrayed and feels hopeless, he learns about resilience, faith, and how to turn challenges into opportunities.

Plot:
1. The Young Dreamer
Lucas is the youngest of four brothers. He is quiet and focused on his dreams, unlike his siblings. Since he was little, he has loved drawing games and telling stories to inspire people. But his brothers don’t understand him and often make fun of his ideas.

One day, Lucas shares a dream where he creates a game that changes lives and becomes famous worldwide. His family laughs at him, calling it a "silly dream."

2. The Betrayal
Lucas’s brothers grow jealous because their parents support Lucas more than them. During a family trip, they decide to prank him, but it goes too far. They delete all his work from his laptop, including his ideas for an important game competition. Lucas loses months of hard work and feels broken.

This betrayal makes Lucas question his worth and his faith in himself.

3. The 'Valley of Pain'
Feeling hopeless, Lucas starts working at a computer repair shop to help with family expenses. He believes his dreams are now impossible. At the shop, he meets Mariana, a young musician who also feels stuck in life. Mariana tells him not to give up and shares the story of Joseph from the Bible. She explains how challenges can make someone stronger.

Lucas realizes his journey isn’t over yet.

4. New Opportunities
One day, a customer comes to the shop with a broken virtual reality device. Lucas fixes it perfectly. The customer is impressed and reveals he is the CEO of a gaming company. He offers Lucas an internship.

Lucas starts working at the company but finds it hard to balance school, his shop job, and the internship. Some of his coworkers try to make him doubt himself, but Lucas pushes through.

5. Modern Egypt
During the internship, Lucas presents a game idea based on his own struggles with hope and resilience. To his surprise, the game becomes a huge success. Lucas earns respect for his creativity and gets a promotion.

6. Forgiveness and Purpose
With his success, Lucas helps other young creators who feel lost, just like he once did. Later, his brothers face financial problems and come to him for help. Instead of being angry, Lucas forgives them and supports them. He realizes that all the pain he went through made him stronger.

Lucas learns that success isn’t just about fame—it’s about inspiring others and spreading hope.
