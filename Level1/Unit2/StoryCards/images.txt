Once upon a time, God asked Noah to build a big ark. He told Noah to take two of each animal.

Noah watched the big elephants walking up into the ark.

- "What is that, Noah?" - asked Noah's son.
- "It's an elephant! The elephant goes TRUMPET! PAAAAR!" - answered Noah.

Soon after, two fluffy sheep walked into the ark.

- "What animal is that?" - asked Noah's son.
- "They are sheep! They go BAA! BAA!" - said Noah, smiling.

Next, a pair of lions roared as they entered the ark.

- "Daddy, what animal is that?"
- "It's a lion! It goes ROAR! GROWL!"

Noah saw two little ducks waddling to the ark.

- "What is that, Noah?"
- "They are ducks! They go QUACK! QUACK!"

#imagem6
Finally, Noah saw two dogs walking up into the ark, wagging their tails.

- "What animal is that, Daddy?"
- "They are dogs! They go WOOF! WOOF!"

The ark was full of animals. There were elephants, sheep, lions, ducks, and dogs, all making their sounds. God cared for all the animals, and Noah and his family cared for them too. God cares about animals and wants us to take good care of them too!
