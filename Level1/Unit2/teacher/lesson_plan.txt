### Lesson Structure (2 hours per Lesson)

This is the first activity of the lesson and should be led by the teacher with the entire class gathered together.

- Present the unit theme and the Bible story, or the main grammar point or video of the day.

The teacher can vary the way activities are applied:

- Some activities can be done in teams, promoting friendly competition where groups answer on the big screen and earn points.

The goal is to encourage active and playful participation, ensuring meaningful learning.

During individual tasks, the teacher should provide personalized support according to each student's needs.
