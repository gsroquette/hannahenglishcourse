Methodology and Teaching Resources
 A Hannah English Course App
•	Stories, videos, and songs specifically designed to teach English based on the biblical content studied in each unit.
•	Phase structure (gamification), motivating students to progress as they complete the activities.
•	Robot Samuel (Educational AI):
o	Interacts individually with the student to practice conversation according to the unit studied.
o	Corrects pronunciation and grammatical errors in real time.
o	Provides comments and text corrections in some written activities.
•	Interactive activities (games, quizzes, songs) to reinforce the content.
•	Tutor support: the app provides guidelines on how to conduct activities, as well as student performance reports.
•	Alignment with the CEFR curriculum:
o	The CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) is an international standard describing linguistic abilities at different levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). Hannah English Course is designed to gradually cover these competencies, ensuring a structured and internationally recognized progression.
