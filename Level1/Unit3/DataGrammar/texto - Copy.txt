Title: The Use of Adverbs of Frequency in the Story of Cain and Abel

# GRAMMAR  
Adverbs of frequency like **always**, **usually**, **often**, **sometimes**, **never**, **just**, **still**, **already**, **both**, etc., are used to describe how often something happens.

These adverbs usually go **in the middle of the sentence**, before the main verb:

- Cain **often** worked in the fields.  
- Abel **usually** took care of the sheep.  
- God **never** ignores our actions.  

But these adverbs go **after** the verb *be* (*am/is/are/was/were*):

- Cain *was often* angry.  
- Abel *was always* kind.  
- God *is always* just.  

TableStart  
Before the main verb | After the verb be  
Cain often gave offerings. | Cain was often angry.  
Abel usually helped. | Abel was always calm.  
They never listened. | God is never unfair.  
God sometimes warned them. | Cain was still jealous.  
TableEnd  

These adverbs also go **between two verbs** (*can ... find*, *have ... been*, etc.):

- God *can always* see our hearts.  
- Cain *could never* hide his feelings.  
- *Have you ever* made a bad choice?  
- Abel *had always* loved God.

TableStart  
Two verbs | Adverb in the middle  
God can see. | God can always see.  
Cain could hide. | Cain could never hide.  
They have obeyed. | They have often obeyed.  
We should love. | We should always love.
