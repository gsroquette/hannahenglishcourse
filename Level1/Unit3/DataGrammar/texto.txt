Title: Frequency Adverbs – Meaning and First Steps – Cain and Abel Story  

# GRAMMAR  

**1. What each adverb means**  
These adverbs show **how often** something happens. Think of them as points on a scale from 0 % (never) to 100 % (always).  

TableStart  
Adverb | Approx. % | Meaning in simple words | Bible-story example  
always | 100 % | every time, without exception | Abel **always** offers his best sheep to God.  
usually | 80–90 % | almost every time | Adam and Eve **usually** pray in the evening.  
often | 60–70 % | many times | Cain **often** works in the fields.  
sometimes | 40–50 % | at times / not regularly | Cain **sometimes** feels jealous.  
rarely | 10–20 % | not many times | Abel **rarely** complains.  
seldom | 10–20 % | almost never (formal) | The family **seldom** forgets God’s words.  
never | 0 % | not at any time | God **never** ignores justice.  
TableEnd  

> **Tip:** *rarely* and *seldom* mean the same; *seldom* sounds a little more formal.  

**2. "Ever" and "Never" in Negative Sentences**  
Use **"never"** to say something **does not happen at any time**.  
Use **"ever"** in **negative sentences with “not”** (especially with *have/has* or *do/does*) to mean “at any time”.  

Examples:  
- Abel has **never** disobeyed God. (= zero times in his life)  
- Cain does **not ever** offer his best. (= at no time does he do this)  

> ✅ *Tip:* You can say **“never”** by itself, or use **“not + ever”** – both are correct, but **“never”** is more common and natural.
