Title: Talking About Routines with Frequency Adverbs

# Introduction to the Conversation Topic
In daily life, we often talk about things we do regularly. We use **frequency adverbs** to say how often we do something. These words help us describe our routines and habits. Talking about your daily routine is a great way to practice the **present simple** and learn useful vocabulary.

Here are some common actions:
- wake up
- brush my teeth
- pray
- go to school
- help my parents
- eat breakfast
- read the Bible
- play with friends

Use adverbs like **always**, **usually**, **often**, **sometimes**, **rarely**, and **never** to describe how often you do these things.
