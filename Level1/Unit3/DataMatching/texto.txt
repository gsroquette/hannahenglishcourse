Lesson | We all have different gifts and jobs. | People can have different roles, and that is good. | “Abel took care of sheep. Cain farmed the land.” (Genesis 4:2, NIrV)

Lesson | Jealousy leads to sin. | When we feel jealous, we must be careful and choose good. | “The Lord said to Cain, ‘Why are you angry? Why are you looking so sad? Do what is right. Then you will be accepted. If you don’t do what is right, sin is waiting at your door. It wants to have you. But you must rule over it.’” (Genesis 4:6-7, NIrV)
