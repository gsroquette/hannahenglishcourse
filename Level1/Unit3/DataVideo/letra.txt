The Story of Caim e Abel (Gênesis 4)


Hello! Today we will hear a special story from the Bible. It is about two brothers: Cain and Abel. In this story, we will learn about love, jealousy, and making good choices. Are you ready? Let’s start!

Cain and Abel were sons of Adam and Eve. They always lived with their family. God was very important in their family.

Abel usually took care of the sheep. Cain often worked in the fields. They had different jobs.

One day, they gave offerings to God. Abel gave his best sheep with love. Cain gave some fruits, but not his best.

God was happy with Abel’s gift, but not with Cain’s. Cain felt very angry. He often looked at Abel with jealousy.

God spoke to Cain. He said, “Do what is right.” Cain did not listen. He asked Abel to go to the field with him.

Cain hurt his brother. Abel died. This was a very bad choice.

God asked, “Where is your brother?” Cain answered, “I do not know.” But God knew everything.

God said Cain must leave his home. He often warned people to do what is right.

Cain went away. He was sad and alone. God still gave him protection. God is just, but He is also merciful.

We must always choose what is right. God sees our hearts. He wants us to love, not hate.
