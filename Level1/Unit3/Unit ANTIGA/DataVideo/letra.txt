The Story of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3)


"Adam and Eve are in the Garden of Eden. The garden is beautiful and full of trees. God says, 'You can eat from every tree, but not this one.' God gives us choices and teaches us to obey Him."


"There is a tree in the middle of the garden. The tree is called the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. God’s rules protect us from harm."


"The serpent talks to Eve. The serpent says, 'Are you sure God said that? You will not die.' Satan tries to trick us with lies."


"Eve eats the fruit. She gives the fruit to Adam, and he eats too. Disobedience brings trouble."


"Adam and Eve are hiding. God asks, 'Where are you?' God sees us and calls us to Him, even when we sin."


"Adam says, 'Eve gave me the fruit.' Eve says, 'The serpent tricked me.' We must take responsibility for our actions."


"God says, 'The serpent will crawl, Eve will have pain, and Adam will work hard.' Adam and Eve must leave the garden. Sin has consequences, but God is still with us."


"God makes clothes for Adam and Eve. He still loves them, even though they sinned. God’s love is greater than our mistakes."


"Adam and Eve are outside the garden. God puts an angel to guard the gate. God’s holiness separates us from Him, but He makes a way back."


"God promises to send a Savior. Jesus will save us from sin and bring us back to Him. God’s plan is perfect, and He always keeps His promises."
