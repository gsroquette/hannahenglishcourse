Title: The Definite Article - The Creation Story

# GRAMMAR
Subtitle: 1. The Definite Article: "the"
Text: Use "the" when talking about something specific or something that has already been mentioned.
"The" is used before both singular and plural nouns, as well as with nouns that start with a consonant or vowel sound.

Subtitle: 2. Examples
Examples from the Creation Story:
"The earth was empty and dark." (There is only one earth, so it is specific.)
"God saw the light and said it was good." (This refers to the specific light that God created.)
"The sun and the moon were made to govern the day and the night." (These are specific celestial bodies.)

Subtitle: 3. Difference Between "the" and "a" or "an"
Text: "The" is used when the noun it refers to is known to both the speaker and the listener, while "a" or "an" is used when the noun is being mentioned for the first time or when it is not specific.

Examples from the Creation Story:
"God created a light." (This is the first mention of light, so it is not specific.)
"The light separated the day from the night." (This refers to the specific light already mentioned.)
"He created an apple tree." (Any apple tree, not specific.)
"The apple tree was in the Garden of Eden." (A specific tree that was already mentioned.)
