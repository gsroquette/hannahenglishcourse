In a big valley, there is a battlefield. On one side, there are the Israelites, and on the other side, there are the Philistines. There is a giant warrior named Goliath standing with the Philistines. He is very tall and strong.

In a small village, there is a young shepherd named David. David is not a soldier; there are sheep that he takes care of. David loves God and believes in His power.

#imagem3
There is fear in the hearts of the Israelites. Every day, Goliath comes out and shouts, “Is there anyone brave enough to fight me?” But there is no one who dares to challenge him.

#imagem4
One day, David’s father says, “David, there are your brothers in the army. Take this food to them.” David obeys and goes to the battlefield.

#imagem5
When David arrives, there is Goliath, shouting again. David sees that there is no one willing to fight Goliath. David is not afraid. He believes there is God with him.

David tells King Saul, “There is no need to fear. There is God who will help me fight Goliath.” King Saul says, “But you are just a boy.” David replies, “There are lions and bears that I have fought before. God saved me then, and He will save me now.”

David goes to the river, and there are five smooth stones. There is also a slingshot in his hand. He takes the stones and walks to face Goliath.

#imagem8
Goliath laughs when he sees David. He says, “Is this a joke? There is no one stronger to fight me?” But David says, “There is God with me, and He is stronger than you.”

#imagem9
David puts a stone in his slingshot and swings it. The stone flies through the air, and there is a loud sound as it hits Goliath's forehead. Goliath falls to the ground.

There is silence on the battlefield. There are cheers from the Israelites. David won because there is faith and courage in his heart. He trusted in God, and God helped him win the victory.
