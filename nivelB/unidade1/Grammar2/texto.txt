# Additional Practice:
Text: Encourage students to create their own negative and interrogative sentences using "there is" and "there are." For example, they can describe what is not present in a familiar place like their home, school, or a fictional setting from a story they enjoy. Additionally, ask them to formulate questions about these settings, such as "Is there a book on the table?" or "Are there any toys in the box?" This practice will help reinforce their ability to form negative and interrogative sentences, as well as deepen their understanding of how these structures are used in different contexts.
