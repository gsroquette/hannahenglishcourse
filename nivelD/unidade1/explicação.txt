<h2>Dear Teacher,</h2>
<p>
    This guide is designed to help you use the interactive resources available on our website effectively, ensuring that your students learn English in an engaging and participatory way. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use each tool to maximize your students' learning experience.
</p>

<h3>1. Story Cards: Exploring the Story</h3>
<p>
    Start the lesson by accessing the Story Cards. Explore the images with your students, asking questions about what they see and what they think the story is about. This helps stimulate their imagination and active participation. After this initial exploration, have the students listen to the story while they view the images.
</p>
<p>
    Next, display the story text and read it together with your students. Take the opportunity to focus on sentences that contain "there is" and "there are," which are the grammar topics for this lesson. This reading time is crucial for consolidating understanding and usage of these expressions.
</p>

<h3>2. Flash Cards: Learning Vocabulary</h3>
<p>
    After the story, access the Flash Cards to study the vocabulary. Show the images and ask the students to identify the words that represent those images. Then, flip the cards to reveal the words and have the students read them aloud. This is an ideal time for students to write the words in their notebooks, reinforcing learning through writing.
</p>

<h3>3. Memory Game: Reinforcing Vocabulary</h3>
<p>
    The Memory Game is an excellent tool for reinforcing newly learned words. Play the game with your students as they match images to words, helping them solidify their vocabulary in a fun and interactive way. This game not only reinforces vocabulary but also helps improve concentration and memory.
</p>

<h3>4. Word Search: Strengthening Vocabulary</h3>
<p>
    The Word Search is another great resource for vocabulary reinforcement. Students can complete the word search directly on the screen, or you can print a copy for each student. This activity is perfect for reinforcing spelling and ensuring that students thoroughly internalize the new words.
</p>

<h3>5. Fill in the Blanks: Practicing Grammar</h3>
<p>
    In the Fill in the Blanks game, students will practice using "there is" and "there are." They can complete the sentences directly on the screen, or you can print the activity for each student to complete individually before checking the answers together on the screen. This practice is essential for students to gain confidence in using these expressions in various contexts.
</p>

<h3>6. Quiz: Testing Comprehension</h3>
<p>
    To conclude the lesson, access the Quiz. This is a great opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding of the story in a fun and competitive way. You can divide the class into teams and keep score, encouraging everyone's participation. The quiz helps reinforce content dynamically and engagingly.
</p>

<h3>7. Retelling the Story</h3>
<p>
    To close the lesson, return to the Story Cards images and ask the students to retell the story in their own words. This activity not only reinforces vocabulary and grammar structures but also encourages creativity and confidence in expressing themselves in English.
</p>

<p>
    Remember, the lesson should be fun, educational, and, above all, should encourage active participation from the students. Use these resources to create a stimulating learning environment where your students feel motivated to explore and learn more.

<p><strong>Happy teaching!</strong></p>
